# Module 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

## Description

A basic landing page for myself, built using HTML and CSS. The page includes a header and footer, an image with caption, a (non-functioning) form, and a polished UI.

This project allows me to have a professional presence on the internet. It allows people to contact me and see my portfolio, as well as (pretend to) submit their information to get in contact. More importantly, it allowed me to practice my basic HTML and CSS skills.

I learned by experience how to go from a totally blank HTML document to a reasonably nice looking webpage.
